  <h1 class="text-align-center">A few fun facts</h1>
  <p class="text-align-center">I love green tea,  my favorite number is 6 (The day i was born :P),&nbsp; I love to paint potraits, my hobbies changes with my mood, I do skiping regularly,&nbsp;my favorite food is daal-bati and I have tendency to fall.</p>


  <h1 class="text-align-center">A look into my life</h1>
  <p class="text-align-center">During monsoon, I enjoy traveling to some great green mountain locations or finding a remote lake somewhere new for kayaking. Although the majority of the year, you will find me behind a computer screen. I am a passionate programmer.&nbsp;

  <p class="text-align-center">Having been put through some bad experiences in my past, I've also had some great ones that&nbsp;allowed me to work with some amazing people who have played key roles in my career. I have worked very hard to get where I am today, but I'm just as passionate about where my career is leading me. The challenges that I deal with on a day-to-day basis I find meaningful and rewarding. Bottom line: I love what I do and I will do whatever it takes to further my career.&nbsp;
