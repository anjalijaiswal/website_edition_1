  <h1 class="text-align-center">The Fun Loving Me!</h1>
  <p class="text-align-center"> I think I have, what you call a wanderer soul. Breathtaking views, twisty roads, hole-in-the-wall restaurants with awesome food and
    unexpected wonders along the way, I mean who wouldn't love that!

  <h1 class="text-align-center">The Artistic Me!</h1>
  <p class="text-align-center"> I think god blessed me with inherent skills of art. Whenever I feel stuck I just take out
    my brushes and start painting something pretty! Or lately my knifes :P, just kidding.
    I like to experiment with different mediums and styles. You can see below how well I have fared till date.
