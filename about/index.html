  <!-- <h1 class="text-align-center">About Me</h1> -->
  <p class="text-align-center">
    My name is Anjali Jaiswal, and I enjoy meeting new people and having great intellectual conversations with them.
    Working as Full Stack developer, I am responsible for core components of the projects and working with Product Owner/Architects
    to deliver high quality software. I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player.

  <h1 class="text-align-center">A look into my life</h1>
  <p class="text-align-center">During monsoon, I enjoy traveling to some great green mountain locations or finding a '
    remote lake somewhere new for kayaking. Although the majority of the year, you will find me behind a computer screen.
     I am a passionate programmer.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p class="text-align-center">Having been put through some bad experiences in my past, I've also had some great ones that&nbsp;
    allowed me to work with some amazing people who have played key roles in my career.
    I have worked very hard to get where I am today, but I'm just as passionate about where my career is leading me.
    The challenges that I deal with on a day-to-day basis I find meaningful and rewarding.
    Bottom line: I love what I do and I will do whatever it takes to further my career.&nbsp;
