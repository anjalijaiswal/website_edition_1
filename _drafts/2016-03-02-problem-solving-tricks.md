Trick One: List all Constraints.

Trick Two: List all Operations.

Trick Three: Break down the problem into smaller problems.

<!-- If you are unaware of all possible actions you could take, you may be unable to solve the problem. We can refer to these actions as operations.  -->
<!-- More generally, by restating a problem in more formal terms, we can often uncover solutions that would have otherwise eluded us. -->
<!-- Restating the problem in a more formal manner is a great technique for gaining insight into a problem. Many programmers seek out other programmers to discuss a problem, not just because other programmers may have the answer but also because articulating the problem out loud often triggers new and useful thoughts. Restating a problem is like having that discussion with another programmer, except that you are playing both parts. -->

<!-- The broader lesson is that thinking about the problem may be as productive, or in some cases more productive, than thinking about the solution. In many cases, the correct approach to the solution is the solution. -->
