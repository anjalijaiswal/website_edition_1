I was writing test cases for a Rails application where i encountered the need for mocks and stubs. Since it was the first time i had to use them i thought of sharing my learnings with you. Lets get started with the terminologies:

    * **Stub** - fake implementation of a method
    * **Mock** - fake implementation of an object
    * **Double** - a newer term to represent an object that stands in for another object

I will talk about double in another **[this](){:target="_blank"}** post.
