Last month I attended RubyConf India. It was held at Le Meridien, Kochi. Kochi is a vibrant city and breathtakingly scenic, and Kerala truly deserves the title - God's own country. It's simply enchanting. To attend a conference while surrounded by so much beauty and intelligence was a pleasure to both eyes and brain.

The first day of conference started with keynote by Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) - The Creator of Ruby language! He talked about Ruby's features and future. He said his focus is going to be on making Ruby better for embedded systems and scientific computing for the next couple of years. He also discussed about Ruby’s concurrency model and performance in  Ruby 3. He also added that it’ll be 3 times as fast as it currently is. That surely excited the developers in the hall.

After that I attended the talk on anatomy of constant lookup and autoloading in Ruby by Prathamesh Sonpatki. He talked about how modules and classes are constants in Ruby and how Ruby deals with them.

Next talk was by Shobhit Srivastava on “Hidden features in Ruby you may not know about”. He gave pointers on how we can use certain features in Ruby REPL like underscore to get previous result, semicolon to suppress big values, various gems to beautify your console result and how you can initialize a hash with default values.

Katrina Owen presented a very interesting talk named “Succession” on code refactoring. She gave few pointers on Naming Conventions. She also stressed that while refactoring one should ignore the similarities and one has to get dirty before one can start cleaning the code. I had a wonderful conversation with her afterwards in which she talked about her blog, the book she co-authored and her future plans for Exercism. I was excited to hear about Exercism as I did my first open-source contribution in Exercism <3.

Next I attended Sarah Mei's “Factory, Workshop, Stage”. She talked in depth about how creation of software industry is rooted in the metaphors of manufacturing industry. She stressed that we should consider a new model for software development that places the people who do it in the center of the picture instead of on the periphery and see what new insights we can get about our projects.

The day winded up with Lightening Talks. That is the most interesting part of Ruby Conferences. People are very open and receiving. Generally novice builds up the courage and prepare for future talks through this very stage.

The second day began with a keynote by Laurent Sansonetti. He is the founder of HipByte and the developer of RubyMotion. He spoke eloquently about how RubyMotion could be used to write code for Android and iOS apps through Ruby.

Jon McCartie gave an interesting presentation - “From Facepalm to Foolproof". He shared some tips on deployment and running an app in production.

The conference ended with Charles Nutter‘s talk on — “Ruby Performance: The Last Mile”. He threw some light on how JRuby solves Ruby’s performance and concurrency problems.

Ruby Conferences are great way to know what is happening in the Ruby world and what other Rubyists are thinking. They come from all over the world to share their knowledge on different aspects of Ruby. The talks are interesting, informative and educational and also they provide us with new ideas. It's always a great learning experience both listening to other people's ideas and to have unique, personal and insightful conversations with people.
