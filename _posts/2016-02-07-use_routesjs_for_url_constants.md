We have often heard the term 'Separation of concerns', we tend to decouple our app into a series of independent components, but do we really do it all the way? Give some thoughts â€ o it.

All of us have used ajax calls with our rails projects. This is how we generally do it:
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
$.ajax
  url: '/welcome'
  data: 'Hello User'
  type: 'GET'
  dataType: 'json'
{% endhighlight %}

We go directly and use urls as strings instead of making them a constant. I don't like hardcoding absolute URLs in my JavaScript code, it's bad practice anyway. So how can you make your urls as constant?

Lets say I am using CoffeeScript in my rails project. We will create a routes.js file in which we will  save all our routes which we want to use.

routes.js.coffee
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# Make a global constant
window.DEFINE_ROUTE = {}
# Assign a value to 'welcomePath' property
Object.defineProperty DEFINE_ROUTE, 'welcomePath', value: '/welcome'
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can call our constant, 'DEFINE_ROUTE' in ajax call.

welcome.js.coffee
{% highlight ruby linenos %}
$.ajax
  url: DEFINE_ROUTE.welcomePath
  data: 'Hello User'
  type: 'GET'
  dataType: 'json'
{% endhighlight %}
